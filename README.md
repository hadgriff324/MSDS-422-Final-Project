# Unlocking Sales Potential: 
# Forecasting for a Major Ecuadorian Grocerer
Corporacion Favorita is a large Ecuadorian-based grocery retailer. The purpose of the project was to create a model to accurately predict the unit sales for thousands of items sold at the various Favorita Stores. By having the ability to accuratly forecast can not only reduce overstocking and foodwaste, but also improve overall customer satisfaction. 

Four models were created: ARIMA, MLP Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, and XGBoost. XGBoost was found to be the most optimal model, after hyperparameter tuning, based off of r^2, MAE, and RMSE values. 

The data analyzed was from Kaggle: (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting/models)
